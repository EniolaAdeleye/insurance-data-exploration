# Insurance data exploration
---------------------------
The goal of this project is to determine the contribution to the high cost of insurance.
The dataset has 7 columns(age, sex, number of children, region, smoker, bmi, and charges)
The following assumptions were made for this project:
---------------------------
i. The cost of insurance increases when an individual has an unhealthy lifestyle, is older than the average age and has at least one child.\
ii.  Unhealty lifestyles include smoking, and having a bmi above average.\

The dataset was analyzed by region. The Northeast region was found to be the most populated region and had the highest mean cost of insurance. This region was also found to have the highest percent of people with bmi above the average rate and smokers. The findings obtained shows that the biggest contributing factor to the high cost of insurance is having a high bmi and being a smoker.
